# nbaapp
All current NBA Players Ranked from best to worst

This project uses the NBA_API downloaded from GitHub

This code works as three seperate dataframes funneling into one file that creates a web app through Streamlit. 

The three dataframes come from:
  careerstats.py
  nba_app.py
  playergamelogs.py
 
The file that runs all of the above is:
  nbamultiapp.py 
which has streamlit code in it.
